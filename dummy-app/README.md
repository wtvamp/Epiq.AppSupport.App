### Developing

Based on [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). You will need node installed to continue.

Install required dependencies for the project in command prompt from the project directory with:

`npm install`

or if you use [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)

`yarn`

For all following commands, you can just replace `npm` with `yarn` if yarn is what you are using.

To build and run the application in a development server with [hot reloading](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/hot-module-replacement-with-webpack):

`npm start`

A dev server will be started on port 3000. You can configure the dev server in webpack.config.js.

To package the JavaScript using webpack:

`npm run build`

To run test:

`npm test`

To run tests continuously:

`npm test:watch`
